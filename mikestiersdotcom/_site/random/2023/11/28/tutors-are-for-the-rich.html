<p>when i was a kid i used to think people that went to tutors were trying to get the best grades possible.  about 5 years ago i decided to speedrun all of high school math again by hiring a 1:1 tutor for 18 months.  that’s speedy enough for me because i was one of those “i’m not a math person” persons.  it wasn’t as hard as i remember it, but it was on my own terms.  i still struggled with understanding where some of it was applicable, but i just grinded through it because it was a goal i needed to complete.  some of it was enlightening, but it still felt a bit foreign.</p>

<p>making a video game though?  damn son.  it all makes so much sense now.  i’m still not what i would consider a “math person”, but i see where this stuff is applied now and it’s so satisfying to understand it is at least applicable to something relevant to me.  someone could still say to me…</p>

<p>“math describes the world”</p>

<p>i would politely nod.  i have a vague idea of what they mean, but it feels empty.</p>

<p>now if someone said to me….</p>

<p>“math describes the world you’re creating in a video game”????</p>

<p>i’m locked in.  i get you.  i hear you.</p>

<p>i was on a math podcast when i completed the tutoring and i plan on going back on when i’m finished this diploma.  check it out <a href="https://www.maththerapypodcast.com/1734392/8155455">Math Therapy s2e06</a>.</p>

<p>tutoring is the best.  i’m glad chatgpt is democratizing this privilege.</p>
