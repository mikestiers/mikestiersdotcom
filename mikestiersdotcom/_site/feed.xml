&lt;p&gt;making a video game though?  damn son.  it all makes so much sense now.  i’m still not what i would consider a “math person”, but i see where this stuff is applied now and it’s so satisfying to understand it is at least applicable to something relevant to me.  someone could still say to me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“math describes the world”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i would politely nod.  i have a vague idea of what they mean, but it feels empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now if someone said to me….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“math describes the world you’re creating in a video game”????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m locked in.  i get you.  i hear you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was on a math podcast when i completed the tutoring and i plan on going back on when i’m finished this diploma.  check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maththerapypodcast.com/1734392/8155455&quot;&gt;Math Therapy s2e06&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know what happens to big boys?  they get big boy challenges and c++ in unreal feels challenging compared to unity c# and unreal blueprints.  my favorite aspect of c++ in unreal is that it satisfies something that has bugged me forever; being able to read someone else’s c++ code and understand what some of the more esoteric things mean.  the fact that i can hang in those typical saturday night pub conversation about pointers now is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why has it bugged me for so long?  when i was 15 i had a summer where i didn’t have a job and a lot of time on my hands.  i told myself i was going to buy a c++ book and create an application.  i took one look at the book and thought “i’m too dumb for this” and then played video games.  reality is i was dumb for thinking i was too dumb.  2025 is gonna be the year of assembly.  come at me bro.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">working in c++ for unreal is pretty dope. it feels so good to write something fun in c++ that’s not a console application. makes me feel like a big boy.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">quaternions be crazy</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/random/2023/11/14/quaternions-be-crazy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="quaternions be crazy" /><published>2023-11-14T11:14:11-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-14T11:14:11-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/random/2023/11/14/quaternions-be-crazy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/random/2023/11/14/quaternions-be-crazy.html">&lt;p&gt;quaternions are pretty interesting.  i’m not going to pretend i fully understand them, but it’s kind of a funny thing about math and game dev.  you need to be aware of it, but you don’t actually have to be well-versed in it.  i frequently see people type “quaternion.identity” in their code and when pressed for an explanation, it’s usually “that’s just what you usually do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i wanted to try and dumb it down to a sentence that is better than “that’s just what you do” for in the future when someone maybe asks me why i’m doing it.  so first off, quaternion.identity is just 1 so i think of it like “i need to provide a rotation value but i don’t want it rotated, so multiply this thing by 1, so don’t really do anything to it”.  think of it like you want this thing to appear and you don’t want it to rotate at all from the original orientation of the model. why “identity” though?  because it’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix&quot;&gt;identity matrix&lt;/a&gt; and it’s just one of those magical matrix transformations like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix&quot;&gt;clockwise rotation matrix, counter-clockwise rotation matrix, etc…&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but what’s the deal with that word quaternion?  i haven’t really explained it very well, have i?  i should feel like a big dumb faker, right?  yeah, i thought so too, but then i read the unity api docs and it said this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;such a casual flex in the documentation, right?  now i don’t feel so bad.  but don’t let that stop you from learning.  you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m making video games now.  pretty neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i already have a programming diploma, but i refuse to call myself a programmer, yet.  i’ve ran scripting classes, i’ve passed dev certifications, i can write infrastructure as code for the largest IaC projects in the world, but i still feel i can’t hang with the cool kids.  javascript frameworks make me sad and (some) backend just doesn’t do it for me.  game dev though?  spending an embarassing 60 hours figuring out how to make a low poly car drift?  recreating a game that already exists for the fun of it?  creating something that nobody will ever see or play just for the satisfaction of it?  now we’re talking.  so now i’m gonna be a game developer.  just gotta finish grinding out this new diploma…  2024 is gonna be hype yo.&lt;/p&gt;
