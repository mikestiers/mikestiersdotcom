i could not be more fortunate to have started taking this video game development program just a couple of months before chatgpt was released.  when it first came out, it had this vibe of "oh you're using ai to do your work for you?".  yeah, you *could* do that, but the best part of chatgpt and LLMS is that it is a mentor with infinite patience available 24/7.  i ask it why things work the way they do.  i ask it to tell me what i've done can be done a better way.  i describe something i want to do and it informs me of the tools available to me.  this is easily the most valuable tool i've ever had access to.  gimme that copilot, that chatgpt, that local llm codex.  some people probably said intelisense is cheating.  some people probably said using an ide over stock vi or notepad.exe is cheating.  LLMs halucinate, LLMs can be wrong, it's trained on other people's work! cool story bro.

if i don't know something exists, i can't learn it.  thanks, openai!
