i love setting goals.  every year i set like 50+ goals that are obviously of varying degrees of difficulty.  some are as simple as "go see concert x in city y".  some are harder.  for the past 7 years i kept setting a goal of making a video game, but i just never got around to it because i was hitting a wall so early on.  the closest i got was trying to recreate pacman in monogame and i failed hard.  i was so inexperienced that when the documentation was talking about vectors and i thought it was referring to vector graphics.  i read the tutorials and was blindly typing this stuff about vectors thinking "what the hell does this have to do with a vector image?".  i was able to get pacman to move by holding down an arrow key, but it was just sliding across the screen.  how the hell do i make it stop at the wall?  how do i make it keep moving until it hits a wall?

so many questions.  i was missing some serious foundation work.

i'll save that story for another time, but smash cut 2 years ahead and check out <a href="/games/Annoying_Pacman/index.html" class="iframeLink">Annoying Pacman</a>!.  it's a silly little thing, but it was a huge deal.
