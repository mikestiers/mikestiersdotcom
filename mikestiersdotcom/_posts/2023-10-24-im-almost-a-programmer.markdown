hey

i'm making video games now.  pretty neat, huh?

i already have a programming diploma, but i refuse to call myself a programmer, yet.  i've ran scripting classes, i've passed dev certifications, i can write infrastructure as code for the largest IaC projects in the world, but i still feel i can't hang with the cool kids.  javascript frameworks make me sad and (some) backend just doesn't do it for me.  game dev though?  spending an embarassing 60 hours figuring out how to make a low poly car drift?  recreating a game that already exists for the fun of it?  creating something that nobody will ever see or play just for the satisfaction of it?  now we're talking.  so now i'm gonna be a game developer.  just gotta finish grinding out this new diploma...  2024 is gonna be hype yo.
