when i was a kid i used to think people that went to tutors were trying to get the best grades possible.  about 5 years ago i decided to speedrun all of high school math again by hiring a 1:1 tutor for 18 months.  that's speedy enough for me because i was one of those "i'm not a math person" persons.  it wasn't as hard as i remember it, but it was on my own terms.  i still struggled with understanding where some of it was applicable, but i just grinded through it because it was a goal i needed to complete.  some of it was enlightening, but it still felt a bit foreign.

making a video game though?  damn son.  it all makes so much sense now.  i'm still not what i would consider a "math person", but i see where this stuff is applied now and it's so satisfying to understand it is at least applicable to something relevant to me.  someone could still say to me...

"math describes the world"

i would politely nod.  i have a vague idea of what they mean, but it feels empty.

now if someone said to me....

"math describes the world you're creating in a video game"????

i'm locked in.  i get you.  i hear you.

i was on a math podcast when i completed the tutoring and i plan on going back on when i'm finished this diploma.  check it out [Math Therapy s2e06](https://www.maththerapypodcast.com/1734392/8155455).

tutoring is the best.  i'm glad chatgpt is democratizing this privilege.
