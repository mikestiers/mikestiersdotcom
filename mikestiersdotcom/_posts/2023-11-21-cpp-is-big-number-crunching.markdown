working in c++ for unreal is pretty dope.  it feels so good to write something fun in c++ that's not a console application.  makes me feel like a big boy.

you know what happens to big boys?  they get big boy challenges and c++ in unreal feels challenging compared to unity c# and unreal blueprints.  my favorite aspect of c++ in unreal is that it satisfies something that has bugged me forever; being able to read someone else's c++ code and understand what some of the more esoteric things mean.  the fact that i can hang in those typical saturday night pub conversation about pointers now is huge.

why has it bugged me for so long?  when i was 15 i had a summer where i didn't have a job and a lot of time on my hands.  i told myself i was going to buy a c++ book and create an application.  i took one look at the book and thought "i'm too dumb for this" and then played video games.  reality is i was dumb for thinking i was too dumb.  2025 is gonna be the year of assembly.  come at me bro.
